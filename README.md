# Getting Started with Create React App

This project has been initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Within the project directory, you have the following commands at your disposal:

### `npm start`

Initiates the app in development mode.\
Access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
Changes will trigger page reloads, and lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For further details, refer to the [test running documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Compiles the app for production into the `build` folder.\
React is optimized for performance in production mode, resulting in minified builds with hashed filenames, ready for deployment.\
For deployment guidance, see the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This action is irreversible!**

If you're unsatisfied with the build tool or configuration options, you can execute `eject` at any time. This command removes the single build dependency, copying all configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. From this point, you'll have full control over them, though you'll be on your own.\
While `eject` isn't mandatory and the curated feature set is suitable for most deployments, you can customize it as needed.
